# Soccer Event Database & Analytics
This project involves the design and development of a relational database specifically tailored to store and manage a comprehensive soccer events dataset. Spanning multiple competitions and seasons, this database provides a robust foundation for in-depth sports analytics. Following the schema design, a series of SQL queries were crafted to extract specific data points based on defined criteria, enabling powerful insights into team performance and match statistics.

## Technologies and Skills Used
- SQL: For database schema definition, data manipulation, and complex querying.
- Python: Used for data ingestion, processing, and interacting with the database.
- JSON: Indicates the format of the raw soccer events data, requiring parsing for database insertion.
- Database Design: Core principles applied for creating an efficient, normalized, and scalable database schema.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive Data Storage: A well-structured database designed to hold detailed soccer event data across various leagues and seasons.
- Optimized Schema: Efficient database schema for storing player actions, match events, team statistics, and competition details.
- Advanced Querying Capabilities: Ability to retrieve specific, nuanced data points using SQL queries to answer analytical questions.

Example Query
One of the key functionalities developed was the ability to query specific performance metrics. For instance, to identify teams with the most passes in a particular season:

Scenario: In the La Liga season of 2020/2021, find the teams with the most passes made. Sort them from highest to lowest. Output the team names and the number of passes.

This type of query allows for quick identification of key performance indicators directly from the stored event data.
